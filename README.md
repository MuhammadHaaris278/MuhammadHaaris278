### 🌟 About Me

- 🧠 **AI Whisperer** – If machines could talk, I’d be their best friend.  
- 🎨 **Web Alchemist** – Pixels and code are my paintbrush and canvas.  
- 🎮 **Gamer at Heart** – Debugging in the day, Tekken combos at night.  
- 📚 **Forever a Student** – Tech evolves faster than my WiFi disconnects, so I’m always learning.  

I'm a **Generative AI & Web Development enthusiast** from **Lahore, Pakistan**, passionate about building cool tools, smart assistants, and anything that mixes creativity with code. I live and breathe development, and occasionally yell at bugs (lovingly).
